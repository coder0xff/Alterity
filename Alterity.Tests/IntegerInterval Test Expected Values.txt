#transformed hunk is always start:6 length:4
#transforming hunk is based on table 2
#first two numbers are the result of the transform
#separate number with a tab
#if the first two numbers are zero, the result is no hunks
#second two numbers are an optional additional result
#-1 indicates that an exception must be thrown
#numbers after -1 are ignored and unneeded
#there must be 13 entries in each group
#transforms are grouped as such:
#insert transform selection: deletion undo deletion, deletion redo insertion, deletion subjoin insertion
#delete transform selection: deletion redo deletion, deletion subjoin deletion, deletion undo insertion
#insert transform insertion: insertion undo deletion, insertion redo insertion
#delete transform insertion: insertion redo deletion, insertion subjoin deletion, insertion undo insertion
#insert transform insertion swapped precedence: insertion subjoin insertion
